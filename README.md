## My process

This project was really about going back to basics and return to the world of HTML&CSS, it has been a long time since I made a simpler project and I intend to do more going forward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that I should remember my learnings from earlier classes and not be afraid to go simple to really get some of the absolute basics in. It's important to have a good grasp of these, so I'm happy I can do some repetition.

### Continued development

I definitely want to get better with CSS, to learn the easiest way of creating responsive applications. That will be my main goal going forward.
